# GravityBalls

#Day 1
**Goal:** Create balls that appear to be affected by gravity
* Fork this repository and clone the forked repository. Make sure you're editing the code I've provided, not creating new code
* Cause gravity to affect the single ball provided. Gravity will be _acceleration_ in a particular direction
* Make sure you're remembering to commit _and sync_
* After you have one ball bouncing, create a _branch_ called "CreatingArrays" and remember to _publish_ it
* On this branch, modify your code to have 30 of these gravity balls (or some other number in that range). Once again, remember to commit and sync
* Merge this new branch back in to the master branch
* You're done for the day!
